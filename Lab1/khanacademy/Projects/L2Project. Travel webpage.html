        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p><strong class="hover">Socotra</strong> - a unique place where past meets present. <br> It is an island in the Indian Ocean part of Yemen. Lying between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea and near major shipping routes, Socotra is the largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago, which since 2013 constitutes one of Yemen's governorates.</p>

        <h2>What flora and fauna can you meet?</h2>
        <p>The fauna and flora are as unique as the island itself. Tons of <em class="hover">endemic</em> species await you here! <br> For example, here you can find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Egyptian Vulture</li>

        <h2>How costly is it?</h2>
        <p>Organised tours are the only way to visit Socotra. For a one-week tour, expect to pay between USD1,200 and USD3,000 (per person, excluding flights),
        depending on the Tour Operator and level of service provided.</p>
        <ul><a href="https://www.minimalistjourneys.com/socotra-travel-costs/" target="_blank">Here's what a typical package includes</a>:
            <li><b class="hover">Accommodation:</b> Accommodation options on Socotra range from basic campsites without bathroom facilities and more established campsites with shared bathroom facilities to hotel rooms with private bathrooms and air conditioning (though very few in numbers and in/around Hadibu only)</li>
            <li><b class="hover">Three meals per day:</b> Generally, all packages include breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which are prepared by your guide/driver, your local hosts, or dedicated kitchen staff (in the case of larger groups). However, any food considered luxury, like crustaceans, may not be included in your tour price.</li>
            <li><b class="hover">Activities:</b> All packages include daily guided activities such as hiking, snorkelling, and exploring Socotra’s key attractions. Some activities may be optional and require you to pay separately—for example, entry fees for the Socotra Folk Museum [Google Maps location] or the cost to hire snorkel equipment at Dihamri. Likewise, tips are not included.</li>
            <li><b class="hover">Transportation:</b> Ground transportation, including airport pick-up and drop-off, is included in your tour price. Throughout the trip, 4×4 vehicles (usually Toyota Landcruisers) navigate the island’s rugged terrain. On trekking trips through the Hajhir Mountains, camels carry all the gear (but you’ll have to walk).</li>
            <li><b class="hover">Visa:</b> A visa for Socotra costs between USD150 and USD200 and is valid for 30 days. It is organised through a registered local Tour Operator, your sponsor, who handles the entire process. You’ll need to provide a copy of your passport, and the visa is typically processed within a week to ten days. While many tour packages include the visa cost, some don’t, so confirm. Additionally, some operators, such as Africando, may charge a processing fee or markup on top of the government-mandated visa fee.</li>
        </ul>
